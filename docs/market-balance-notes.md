# Market Balance Notes (Mid-Tier Assets)

Goals
- Fill the gap between starter investments and large purchases.
- Provide meaningful monthly cashflow without trivializing late-game assets.
- Encourage diversification across asset types and risk profiles.

Guidelines
- Mid-tier price band: $2k–$25k base price.
- Annual yield target: ~6%–18% for mid-tier; no single item >20%.
- Risk ratings: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH to reinforce volatility tradeoffs.

Sanity Checks
- Automated: `test/MarketBalance.test.ts` validates mid-tier count and yield bounds.
- Manual: ensure at least one low-risk mid-tier and one high-risk mid-tier per category spread.
